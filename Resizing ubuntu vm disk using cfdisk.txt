- cfdisk

check the free spaces are available means FREE  20Gib
select the partition u want to resize on it means /dev/sda3

choose resize button and write the remaining free size on it and  select write button

now lsblk command will display the resized size
but the df -h command will not because of not resizing the filesystem so 

now resizing the filesystem using below command
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda3

now check both lsblk and df -h command have same result with resized value.
